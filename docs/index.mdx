# Terra-Rebirth Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for Terra-Rebirth, the new blockchain that has forked from the Terra blockchain. Terra is a decentralized and [open-source blockchain](https://github.com/terra-rebirth/core-v2) that hosts a thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and provides advanced developer tools. Terra-Rebirth was created to address a critical bug in the algorithmic stablecoin known as LUNC and serves as an auxiliary method to revive the classic Terra chain.

Terra-Rebirth enables Terra Classic investors to exchange their LUNC tokens in order to burn them from the classic chain. Our goal is to burn at least 1 trillion LUNC tokens at a 1:1 exchange rate from the beginning, with the future exchange rate determined by the market.

Additionally, Terra-Rebirth's algorithm is designed to increase the token's price by at least 7% through inflation. As a substantial number of LUNC tokens are burned from the classic chain, it may positively impact the market price of LUNC.

Please note that there is no option for a reverse swap back to the classic chain. Investors must sell their tokens for a stable coin and then withdraw the funds to repurchase LUNC at the prevailing market price.
